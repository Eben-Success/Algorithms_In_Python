# STACK
A stack is a collection of data in which you can only add a piece of data at the top of the structure or retrieve a piece of data from the top.

### LAST IN, FIRST OUT
## Operations performed by Stack

> Stack can be implemented using one pointer.
> The pointer points to the current element added.

* pop: delete an element.

* add: adding a number on top of data structure.

## Time Complexity is O(1)

# QUEUE

### FIRST IN, FIRST OUT

> Can be implemented using two pointers. First pointer at 1st index, 2nd pointer at the next of the last index.
> If queue is empty, two pointers = 0.
> It stores n-1 elements in an array.

### Operations in Queue

* Dequeue: removing element from queue
* Dequeue: adding element to queue.

* Assuming the number of element does not exceed (n-1), then the time complexity of dequeue and queue is O(1).

## DEQUUE / DOUBLE-ENDED QUEUE
