# Counting Sort

> Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements of an array by couning the number of occurences of each unique elements.

Counting sort works best when the range of values of each element is small.

The count is stored in an auxillary array and the sorting is done by mapping the count as an index of the auxillary array.
